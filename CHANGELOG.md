# Changelog

Current implementation summaries only; the exhaustive pre-cleanup change history lives at [CHANGELOG archive](docs/archive/2026-10-15-pre-cleanup/CHANGELOG.md).

## 2026-10-16 — D192: Fuller breaking surf, native 54-case confirmation

- User native D191 F6 screenshot **54/54 wins, 0 full defeats**; 18 wins for every party size and protagonist, mean HP 86/74/77%, worst 58/42/50%; 78 warnings, 62 wave impacts, 66 pushes and 66 slow resets.
- User real-battle screenshot still showed D189 wave as thin artificial line. Replaced *only* Black Crossing's procedural drawing with layered sea-body polygons, an advancing lifting crest, irregular curled whitecaps, swells, broken wake and restrained spray.
- Left `BlackCrossingSurgeController` gameplay timings, damage, hit lane, push/slow, floor bounds, enemy stats and original approved artwork unchanged. D192 native **visual** F6 is pending; reward→table and #37 release not yet approved. Act1 remains 36/45.

## 2026-10-16 — D191: Black Crossing native-QA parity hardening
- Inspected current GitHub `main` and D190 handoff; D189 surf/floor source exists, native Godot still unavailable in assistant environment.
- Updated Black Crossing 54-case smoke to mirror real battle solo/duo/trio hero spawn positions, floor-depth mapping, and initial placement clamp; replaced artificial hero positions.
- Set explicit release gate of 54/54 wins (not merely 54 completed cases), preserving per-frame plank legality and post-combat slow reset checks.
- No arena/card/unit bitmap, enemy stats, wave behavior, party scaling, or live deck change. Await native F6 playtest + matrix + reward→table confirmation; 36/45 live.

## 2026-10-16 — D190: New-chat checkpoint after D189
- Rechecked live GitHub source; **D189 surf-animation and safe-pier movement correction already committed**, so no duplicate gameplay patch.
- Rewrote canonical `docs/HANDOFF.md` with pre-fix Godot screenshot metrics, the exact two visual issues, D189 code paths and the **post-fix F6 retest still required**.
- Corrected stale status in `PROJECT_STATE` (Black Crossing QA-only `CARD_PATHS` lookup) and stale D187 preview-pending wording. No gameplay, stats or approved art changed; Act1 remains 36/45.

## 2026-10-16 — D189: Black Crossing rolling surf and intact planks fix
- User's native D188 smoke screenshot: historical 54/54 functional PASS (85/78/84% average HP; 81 wave warnings, 58 strikes, 71 pushes and 71 cleanup resets). Separate battle screenshot shows amber rectangle wave and actor soles standing on broken forward beams.
- Replaced overlay rectangles with animated irregular sea foam, crest, water body and spray. Shared `BlackCrossingFloor` gives consistent intact-deck movement bounds for battle spawn/AI, hero drag zone, wave knockback, and 54-case matrix; wave lanes moved to the middle of the deck.
- Strictly local D188 art/geometry change; does not modify enemy HP, run pool or accepted original art. **Native Godot retest after D189 is pending**; prior 54/54 is not a substitute.

## 2026-10-16 — D188: Original Black Crossing battle & scoped wave QA
- User confirmed D187 arena Godot F6 OK; unchanged user-approved selected storm plate and original 25-frame Ferryman/Drowned art.
- Added two unique UnitData and two-placement 1+2 Ferryman/Drowned encounter, QA-only card lookup (not live in Act1), and neutral warned wave strip with bounds-safe push and temporary 30% movement slowdown.
- Added 54-seeded real BattleUnit matrix and isolated real Battle→Reward→Table playtest. Subsequent pre-D189 native matrix confirmed 54/54 functional PASS, but visual/off-floor defects required D189. Act1 remains 36/45.

## 2026-10-16 — D187: Black Crossing storm arena selected and source-integrated
- User approved final clean stormy "Последний причал" after removing the repeated left ruin and right background pier-frame; exported exactly this final image to 1280×720 WebP/Base64.
- Added unique `black_crossing` arena lookup/presentation in existing authored backdrop and visual scripts and clean 1280×720 F6 preview. No crypt atmosphere, no sprites or UI baked into the art.
- Native Godot arena check pending. No encounter waves, enemies/resource data, battle QA or Act1 pool change (36/45).

## 2026-10-15 — D186: Black Crossing original animation visual QA accepted
- User reported «все ок» after F6 for `scenes/dev/black_crossing_animation_preview.tscn`, accepting original Ferryman B and Drowned C five-state animations; no gameplay, art bytes or balance edits needed.
- Began D187 original arena art direction; three distinct 1280×720 battle backdrops to be reviewed before importing anything. Live pool remains 36/45.

## 2026-10-15 — D185: Original Black Crossing combat atlases installed
- Uploaded full Ferryman and Drowned 576×480 atlas WebPs into Godot-compatible tracked `.webp.b64` under `assets/pixel/units/deck_expansion_v1/`; each has 25 distinct/padded cells and 5 unused blank cells verified after local decode.
- Removed visibly disconnected Drowned pixel fragments; retained approved source design and documented one Ferryman derived attack-transition pose.
- Confirmed GitHub blob SHAs match the local encoded raster bytes. Native Godot F6 original-enemy animation acceptance still pending; no #37 encounter, waves, battle or live-pool change.

## 2026-10-15 — D184: Approved Black Crossing combat art and staged original role loader
- User confirmed Ferryman B / Drowned C and approved both generated original animation sprite-sheet previews.
- Locally created two 576×480 atlas candidates, checked 25 distinct alpha-padded poses, five unused transparent cells, documented the Ferryman's originally missing sixth attack pose. Remote raster upload was subsequently completed in D185; native F6 remains unverified.
- Added strict no-fallback D183 role support to MisdealUnitAnimationLibrary and an isolated F6 gallery; **the two `.webp.b64` files have not been committed**. All existing characters, encounters and live pool (36/45) remain untouched.

## 2026-10-15 — D183: Black Crossing card-art native acceptance
- User F6 screenshot + «утверждено»: original third D182 card illustration PASS in the intended 448×274 framing.
- Next combat models need separate silhouette approval, full original 25-frame sprite animation sheets and native QA; no changes to live cards or encounters.
- Current live Act1 **36/45**; release #37 remains gated by original enemies, independent arena, wave mechanic and battle/reward route.

## 2026-10-15 — D182: Black Crossing #37 direction approved, QA-only candidate staged
- User selected new drowned ferryman + two drowned corpse encounter with timed, telegraphed waves, and card-art option #3 (diagonal pier composition).
- Added standalone `resources/cards/black_crossing.tres` and detailed handoff spec; **no live registry/pool change**.
- Approved exact option-3 448×274 image now committed as `black_crossing_approved_v1.webp.b64`; strict loader and F6 art preview added. Remote text matched source export exactly. Native preview and enemies/arena/waves are pending; Act1 remains 36/45.

## 2026-10-15 — D181: D153 release-routing smoke confirmed in Godot
- User screenshot confirms F6 `D153 / ACT 1 RELEASE — PASS`: 36 unique cards, Tier1 controlled offer/choice, encounter routing, Fate Spread resolution, boss XIII gate.
- No gameplay or source edits required. Release #36 verified with this deterministic route fixture; randomized multi-run offer frequency remains untested.
- Next original #37 gameplay and art concept selection pending; D143/D167/D168 remain mandatory.

## 2026-10-15 — D180: D153 releases as Act1 card #36 (native smoke subsequently passed D181)
- Added `threadbare_theatre` to the normal Tier1 `ACT1_CARD_IDS` pool; now 36 unique nonboss cards.
- Fixed former 35-card assumptions in D151/D152/D153 smoke scenes and playtests, avoiding false failure after release.
- Added `threadbare_theatre_release_smoke.tscn`: tests real RunState offer, card selection, encounter routing, Fate Spread choice and boss XIII gating in a deterministic two-card Tier1 fixture.
- Previously confirmed native D176/D177 54/54 combat matrix remains valid for unchanged D153 values. Post-release deterministic normal-deal Godot F6 was subsequently confirmed PASS (D181).

## 2026-10-15 — Documentation hygiene (D179)
- Archived exact pre-cleanup copies of AGENTS, PROJECT_STATE, ROADMAP, DECISIONS, CHANGELOG, old handoffs, visual registry and D153 working docs.
- Consolidated current-state, release gates and next steps into a short canonical set with `docs/INDEX.md` and `docs/HANDOFF.md`; preserved full historical decision references.
- Updated README to the current playable game instead of the original early prototype; clarified Godot/dev test boundaries.
- No changes to gameplay, card pool, unit stats, mechanics, accepted art, or scenes.

## 2026-10-15 — D153 post-balance QA (D176–D178)
- D176: encounter-only Puppet Master/Marionette HP/damage/cadence/movement pass; no global balance changes.
- D177: restored resource serialization, added exact-path `UnitData` diagnostic.
- D178: user native Godot F6 54/54 FUNCTIONAL PASS; average survivor HP 74/67/74% solo/duo/trio, worst 39/15/37%; 123 link / 91 break / 54 master-death breaks.
- Historical D178 state: D153 was QA-only outside the 35-card pool. D180 has activated it; normal-deal regression check pending.

## 2026-10-15 — D153 original art and real battle
- User-approved skeletal marionettes, original crowned puppeteer, 25-pose original animations, selected gothic theatre card scene and moonlit ruined-stage battle arena committed.
- Encounter-local ThreadTether integrated into the real Battle flow (32% mitigation/285px); user previously confirmed battle→reward→table.
- Pre-balance matrix: 54/54 functional PASS with ~85/82–83/86% remaining HP, prompting localized D176 tuning.

## Previous released milestones
- D151 Funeral Procession: original skeletal units/Last Rite, live card **34/45**.
- D152 Defiled Laboratory: original toxic-hazard encounter, environment-led art, live card **35/45**.
- DS2 and Fate Spread Variant C established; earlier events, arenas, tactical cards, UI passes preserved in the archive.

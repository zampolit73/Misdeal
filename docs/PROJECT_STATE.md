# Misdeal — Project State

Last updated: 2026-10-05

## Current status

Misdeal has a working tactical autobattle slice and a first finite run structure.

Confirmed locally by the user:

- base autobattle and restart;
- pre-battle hero placement;
- combat-time unit separation;
- hit/death feedback;
- data-driven `UnitData`;
- Bone Archer keep-distance behavior;
- hard combat-arena bounds;
- first `table -> battle -> reward -> table` loop;
- cleaned-up victory/defeat result overlay.

The original three-victory finite run was implemented and confirmed working locally, then deliberately replaced by the longer Act 1 structure described below.

Phase 3 identity work is underway. The first non-combat event card and one-time event flow are confirmed working locally.

The earlier painted-art integration was locally judged too hard to read in combat. The user chose a dark-fantasy pixel-art direction.

The first pixel-art combat readability redesign is implemented and confirmed working locally.

The second battle presentation pass is implemented and confirmed visually acceptable locally.

The same pixel-art visual language is now applied across the main menu, Whispering Well event, reward screen and run-end screen.

The wizard table has since been rebuilt again around an approved authored pixel-art concept.

The final composition/readability polish pass has been locally verified and accepted:

- encounter hover no longer uses floating tooltips over card art;
- hovering a combat card now swaps the upper wizard-commentary line to that encounter's wizard reaction;
- the Whispering Well has its own hover commentary;
- the HUD and commentary strip are more compact;
- the four cards are slightly smaller, lower and more evenly spaced so the wizard remains visible;
- obsolete procedural skull/goblet/hourglass/books/candle overlays were removed;
- the lower runner/sigil treatment was simplified and subdued.

The original Bone Warden boss encounter, including its 50% HP enrage, was confirmed working locally. After full Act 1 playtesting the user reported that the boss was too easy and visually insufficiently distinct from ordinary combat.

A Bone Warden gameplay + visual rework is implemented in GitHub and pending local verification. The first local pull exposed a Godot 4.7.2 type-inference parser error in the new procedural boss-arena chains; that parser issue was fixed.

After comparing the live battle screenshot against the approved richer pixel mockup, the procedural battle renderer was replaced by an authored full-screen battle backdrop matching the second approved reference much more closely. The first local pull exposed two wiring faults: a truncated 8.7 KB WebP and a negative z-index that placed the backdrop behind the black fallback. Both faults were fixed, and the user has now confirmed the authored battle backdrop looks correct locally.

A full combat-unit sprite art pass is now implemented in GitHub and pending local verification. All nine currently used combat roles have dedicated high-detail dark-fantasy pixel sprites in one 96×96 atlas; special enemies no longer reuse tinted Skeleton art.

The longer Act 1 structure is now confirmed working locally: 12 resolved pre-boss cards followed by the Bone Warden as card 13.

The first real post-structure content batch is implemented: **ПЕПЕЛЬНЫЙ ПРИВАЛ**, **ЛАВКА МОГИЛЬЩИКА** and **КУЗНИЦА ПРОКЛЯТИЙ** have real choices instead of the generic prototype resolver.

The first new combat-content batch is also implemented in GitHub and pending local verification: **МОГИЛЬНЫЙ ЗВОН**, **КОСТЯНАЯ ДАВКА** and **СТРАЖ СКЛЕПА** are real combat cards.

A second real event batch is implemented in GitHub and pending local verification: **ЧЁРНЫЙ АЛТАРЬ**, **ЗАКОВАННЫЙ ПЛЕННИК**, **КОСТИ ДОЛЖНИКА** and **ДЕСЯТИНА ВОЛШЕБНИКА** no longer use the prototype resolver.

The late-game escalation batch is implemented and locally confirmed working: **КАРТА БЕЗ ЛИЦА**, **КРОВАВАЯ КНИГА**, **СЛОМАННАЯ КОРОНА**, **ПОСЛЕДНИЙ ПРИВАЛ** and **ВРАТА ОССУАРИЯ** are real cards.

The final five-card content batch is locally confirmed working: **ГРЕМУЧИЙ МОСТ**, **КОШЕЛЬ МЕРТВЕЦА**, **ТОРГОВЕЦ СВЕЧАМИ**, **КОСТЯНАЯ ПОШЛИНА** and **СТАВКА НА СМЕРТЬ** all have bespoke mechanics. The full 24-card pre-boss Act 1 pool is content-complete with no active prototype-card routes.

The first Act 1 balance/readability pass is implemented in GitHub and pending local verification. It focuses on combat pacing, Death Wager reward inflation and final-boss difficulty rather than broad retuning of every event.

## Player-facing language

All player-facing UI text, card text, reward text, wizard lines and unit display names are Russian.

Technical identifiers, file names, node names, class names and code remain English.

## Engine

- Godot 4.7.x
- GDScript
- Main scene: `res://scenes/main/main.tscn`
- Rendering method: GL Compatibility
- Prototype resolution: 1280×720
- `RunState` is registered as an autoload singleton.

## Current playable flow

### 1. Main screen

`scenes/main/main.tscn`

Pressing **ВОЙТИ В ИГРУ** resets the prototype run and opens the wizard's table.

### 2. Wizard table

`scenes/table/table.tscn`

Act 1 now uses a two-card offer flow:

- the player resolves 12 pre-boss cards;
- before each card, the wizard offers two cards from the current difficulty tier;
- choosing one card removes the rejected alternative from that run;
- cards do not repeat inside the run;
- after cards 1-4 the pool moves from early to mid tier;
- after cards 5-8 it moves from mid to late tier;
- each 4-card tier now guarantees one combat selection: at run start each tier randomly chooses one of its first three slots as the mandatory combat slot, non-combat offers are protected before it, and that slot offers two combat cards;
- later slots in mid/late can still surface the tier's remaining combat card, so a run can contain more than the guaranteed minimum;
- after card 12 the only remaining progression card is **КОСТЯНОЙ НАДЗИРАТЕЛЬ**.

A selected combat card remains active after defeat. Returning to the table shows that same card as **ПОВТОРИТЬ**, rather than generating a fresh offer.

The structural Act 1 pool contains 24 unique pre-boss card definitions: 8 early, 8 mid and 8 late. This is intentionally large enough for twelve two-card offers where the rejected alternative leaves the run.

Currently fully implemented card mechanics:

- **КОСТЯНОЙ ДОЗОР** — three melee Skeleton units;
- **ЗАСАДА НА КЛАДБИЩЕ** — two Skeleton units plus one Bone Archer;
- **ЗАЛП С ВИСЕЛИЦЫ** — one Skeleton plus two Bone Archers;
- **ШЕПЧУЩИЙ КОЛОДЕЦ** — the existing three-choice risk/reward event;
- **ПЕПЕЛЬНЫЙ ПРИВАЛ** — choose +15 party HP, +15 gold, +1 party damage, or leave;
- **ЛАВКА МОГИЛЬЩИКА** — spend gold on +20 party HP, +3 party damage, or a random unowned artifact;
- **КУЗНИЦА ПРОКЛЯТИЙ** — choose one of three hero-specific artifacts, or refuse;
- **МОГИЛЬНЫЙ ЗВОН** — two Skeletons protect a Grave Bellkeeper support enemy;
- **КОСТЯНАЯ ДАВКА** — five weak Bone Thralls pressure the party through numbers and reward splash damage;
- **СТРАЖ СКЛЕПА** — elite Crypt Guard with melee splash plus two Bone Thralls; victory uses a guaranteed-artifact reward flow;
- **ЧЁРНЫЙ АЛТАРЬ** — trade party HP for permanent damage, spend gold for HP, or refuse;
- **ЗАКОВАННЫЙ ПЛЕННИК** — spend gold for a mixed HP/damage benefit, force the chains for a harsher stat trade, loot the prisoner, or leave;
- **КОСТИ ДОЛЖНИКА** — a true 50/50 gold gamble alongside safer deterministic choices;
- **ДЕСЯТИНА ВОЛШЕБНИКА** — pay gold, pay party HP, or refuse and take a temporary wizard debt;
- **КАРТА БЕЗ ЛИЦА** — choose a fully hidden random result, pay for a safe strong result, burn it for a small guaranteed bonus, or leave;
- **КРОВАВАЯ КНИГА** — convert gold into damage, HP into a random general-pool artifact, or damage into HP;
- **СЛОМАННАЯ КОРОНА** — source-locked special artifact choice: all heroes deal +22% damage but lose 10 max HP, with gold/stat alternatives;
- **ПОСЛЕДНИЙ ПРИВАЛ** — late preparation choice between +30 party HP, +3 party damage or +25 gold;
- **ВРАТА ОССУАРИЯ** — heavy late combat combining Crypt Guard, Grave Bellkeeper, Bone Archer and Bone Thrall;
- **ГРЕМУЧИЙ МОСТ** — early traversal risk with a 50/50 sprint, a small guaranteed gold/HP trade, or a safe crossing;
- **КОШЕЛЬ МЕРТВЕЦА** — deterministic greed ladder: more gold costs progressively more party HP;
- **ТОРГОВЕЦ СВЕЧАМИ** — cheap early micro-shop for HP or damage, plus a theft option trading HP for gold;
- **КОСТЯНАЯ ПОШЛИНА** — forced mid-run payment choice: gold, HP, or a harsher HP-for-damage confrontation;
- **СТАВКА НА СМЕРТЬ** — late five-enemy elite combat against Crypt Guard, two Bone Archers and two Bone Thralls, followed by an enhanced reward choice.

All 24 pre-boss cards now have bespoke mechanics. `scenes/event/prototype_card.tscn` remains only as unused legacy prototype infrastructure and is no longer referenced by the active Act 1 card pool.

The table displays:

- current card progress out of 12, or **БОСС**;
- gold;
- party HP bonus;
- party damage bonus.

Selecting a card stores it as the active run card. Combat cards also select their `EncounterData`; event/prototype cards route to their configured scene.

The wizard table now uses a hybrid authored-art + live-UI composition based on the approved concept stored at:

- `assets/concepts/approved_table_direction.png`

The battle screen now follows its own approved pixel-art direction stored at:

- `assets/concepts/approved_battle_direction.jpg`

The battle remains live Godot UI/combat rather than a baked screenshot; the reference is used for composition, density, scale and palette.

Runtime table assets derived from that concept:

- `assets/pixel/table/table_wizard_layer.png` — wizard/room backdrop;
- `assets/pixel/table/misdeal_logo.png` — title logo;
- `assets/pixel/table/cards/bone_patrol.png`;
- `assets/pixel/table/cards/graveyard_ambush.png`;
- `assets/pixel/table/cards/gallows_volley.png`;
- `assets/pixel/table/cards/whispering_well.png`;
- `assets/pixel/table/cards/bone_warden.png` — dedicated final-boss card art.

The lower tabletop, ritual runner and sigil remain procedural so the layout can stay responsive to live UI. Earlier procedural side props and candles were removed after local visual review because they conflicted with the authored backdrop.

The table still uses real Godot `Button` controls. Two existing card slots are now populated dynamically from `RunCardData`, including title, type, description, wizard hover line and art path.

The top HUD remains dynamic and shows actual Act 1 card progress, gold, party HP modifier and damage modifier. If wizard debt is active, **ДОЛГ ВОЛШЕБНИКУ** is also shown in the HUD.

The earlier painted assets under `assets/art/` remain in the repository as historical/reference material.

### 3. Whispering Well event

`scenes/event/whispering_well.tscn`

The first non-combat event offers three choices:

- accept the well's gift: +4 party damage and -15 party HP;
- spend 25 gold: +25 party HP;
- walk away with no stat change.

The event remains one-time because its card leaves the run after being offered. Resolving it now completes the current Act 1 card and advances card progress.

### 4. Combat

`scenes/battle/battle.tscn`

Player party:

- Рыцарь;
- Следопыт;
- Маг.

Enemy composition and spawn positions come from the selected `EncounterData` Resource.

Before combat, the player can drag the three heroes within the deployment zone.

Implemented combat behavior:

- automatic nearest-enemy targeting;
- automatic movement and attacks;
- melee and ranged attack ranges;
- Bone Archer keeps distance and retreats when enemies get too close;
- all combat movement is clamped to the visible arena;
- Mage attacks deal 50% splash damage to nearby secondary enemies;
- separation steering prevents units from stacking into one point;
- HP bars;
- hit flash, impact pulse and floating damage numbers;
- death shrink/fade feedback;
- victory and defeat detection;
- boss units can use data-driven visual scale and a one-time enrage threshold;
- Bone Warden uses its own dedicated high-detail `bone_warden` atlas sprite instead of an enlarged normal Skeleton;
- Bone Warden has 580 HP, 22 base damage, a 60%-damage melee cleave in a 92 px radius, and a larger boss HP/name treatment;
- at 50% HP Bone Warden still enrages, increasing damage, attack speed and movement speed, but now also triggers **Phase II** and summons one Bone Archer plus one Bone Thrall;
- the phase transition changes the boss label to **БОСС • ЯРОСТЬ**, shows a centered **ФАЗА II — ПРИЗЫВ** cue and switches the arena into its stronger phase-two ritual state;
- Grave Bellkeeper is the first support enemy: every 4.5 seconds it heals damaged allied undead within 210 px for 18 HP and shows a visible **ЗВОН!** cue;
- Bone Thrall is a smaller, faster, low-HP swarm enemy;
- Crypt Guard is a slower elite melee enemy with a larger silhouette, visible name and 35% splash damage around its primary target.

Hero stats receive persistent run bonuses from `RunState`. Final spawned hero max HP is clamped to at least 20 and damage to at least 1 so stacking late-run sacrifices cannot create invalid combat units.

After victory, **ЗАБРАТЬ НАГРАДУ** opens the reward scene.

After defeat, **ВЕРНУТЬСЯ К СТОЛУ** returns to the same run without increasing the victory count.

**ПЕРЕИГРАТЬ** remains available as a prototype/testing convenience.

### 5. Reward

`scenes/reward/reward.tscn`

Victory normally offers one of three persistent rewards:

- **КРОВАВАЯ МОНЕТА**: +25 gold;
- **ЖЕЛЕЗНЫЙ ОБЕРЕГ**: +20 HP to every hero;
- **ЗАКАЛЁННАЯ СТАЛЬ**: +3 damage to every hero.

If **ДОЛГ ВОЛШЕБНИКУ** is active, enemy damage is +25% in combat and the next normal reward is doubled to +50 gold / +40 HP / +6 damage. Taking that normal reward clears the debt. Special rewards do not consume the debt: both the Crypt Guard artifact reward and Death Wager enhanced reward leave it active for the next normal reward.

Winning **СТАВКА НА СМЕРТЬ** offers a bespoke enhanced numeric reward: +60 gold, +35 party HP, or +5 party damage. These values were reduced in the first balance pass so one late elite reward does not overwhelm the boss check.

Choosing a reward applies the reward and completes the active combat card.

Normal combat victories return to the table and advance Act 1 card progress.

After defeating Bone Warden and taking its reward, `boss_defeated` becomes true and the player goes to the run-end screen.

### 6. Run end

`scenes/run_end/run_end.tscn`

After 12 resolved pre-boss cards plus the Bone Warden, the run ends and displays:

- pre-boss cards completed;
- combat victories;
- gold;
- accumulated HP bonus;
- accumulated damage bonus.

**НОВЫЙ ЗАБЕГ** resets `RunState` and returns to the wizard's table.

## Current architecture

### Unit data

Reusable combat stats are stored in `UnitData` Resources:

- `scripts/data/unit_data.gd`
- `resources/units/knight.tres`
- `resources/units/ranger.tres`
- `resources/units/mage.tres`
- `resources/units/skeleton.tres`
- `resources/units/bone_archer.tres`
- `resources/units/bone_warden.tres`
- `resources/units/grave_bellkeeper.tres`
- `resources/units/bone_thrall.tres`
- `resources/units/crypt_guard.tres`

Runtime combat state remains on `BattleUnit`.

`UnitData.visual_role` now selects dedicated 96×96 regions from the unified combat atlas:

- `assets/pixel/units/combat_units_v2.png`

Atlas layout:

- row 1: Knight, Ranger, Mage;
- row 2: Skeleton, Bone Archer, Grave Bellkeeper;
- row 3: Bone Thrall, Crypt Guard, Bone Warden.

All nine roles use authored transparent pixel art. Grave Bellkeeper, Bone Thrall and Crypt Guard no longer reuse tinted Skeleton art. The older per-unit PNG files remain in the repository as historical/reference assets but are no longer loaded by combat.

Combat presentation now uses the approved second gothic mockup as an authored static backdrop while keeping all gameplay layers live:

- all current combat roles use the new unified high-detail transparent pixel atlas;
- combat sprites remain substantially larger so silhouettes read like characters rather than small board icons;
- thin blue/red team rings, HP bars, names, drag placement, combat movement and targeting remain live Godot elements;
- the cathedral/crypt architecture, throne/altar, pillars, banners, chains, braziers, skull piles, ritual floor, outer frame and command-panel art are baked into the authored backdrop;
- the authored backdrop is reconstructed at runtime by `scripts/battle/authored_backdrop.gd` from five validated base64 WebP chunks under `assets/pixel/battle/authored_backdrop/`; the decoded image is 1280×720 and uses nearest-neighbor presentation;
- `scripts/battle/battle_visual.gd` no longer draws the general arena and now only adds lightweight dynamic boss-phase overlays;
- the obsolete procedural `scripts/battle/battle_hud_visual.gd` renderer was removed;
- encounter title/status, card progress, faction labels, buttons and result text remain native Godot controls layered over the art;
- **БОЙ** and **ПЕРЕИГРАТЬ** now sit directly over the painted command frames from the backdrop instead of drawing a second competing UI frame.

The older painted unit assets under `assets/art/units/` remain in the repository for reference but are no longer used by combat.

### Encounter data

`scripts/data/encounter_data.gd`

Encounter Resources currently define:

- encounter id;
- Russian title and card text;
- wizard line;
- enemy UnitData paths;
- enemy display names;
- enemy spawn positions;
- optional phase/reinforcement unit paths, names and spawn positions.

Current encounter files:

- `resources/encounters/bone_patrol.tres`
- `resources/encounters/graveyard_ambush.tres`
- `resources/encounters/gallows_volley.tres`
- `resources/encounters/bone_warden.tres` — final-deal boss encounter;
- `resources/encounters/grave_bell.tres`;
- `resources/encounters/bone_crush.tres`;
- `resources/encounters/crypt_guard.tres` — elite encounter with guaranteed artifact reward;
- `resources/encounters/ossuary_gate.tres` — late mixed-archetype combat before the boss;
- `resources/encounters/death_wager.tres` — late five-enemy elite wager encounter.

### Run-card data

`scripts/data/run_card_data.gd`

Act cards are data-driven Resources containing:

- card id;
- Russian title/description/wizard line;
- display type;
- early/mid/late tier;
- resolution type;
- target encounter/event scene;
- art path;
- temporary prototype-result text.

Act 1 card resources live under `resources/cards/`.

### Artifacts

`scripts/data/artifact_data.gd`

The first artifact layer is data-driven and persists for the current run through `RunState.artifact_ids`.

Current artifacts:

- **ЩИТ МЕРТВЕЦА** — Knight +40 HP, -15% move speed;
- **СЛЕПОЙ КОЛЧАН** — Ranger attacks 22% faster but gains +55 minimum range;
- **РАСКОЛОТЫЙ ФОКУС** — Mage deals 15% less primary damage but gains +55 splash radius and +0.25 splash multiplier;
- **СЛОМАННАЯ КОРОНА** — special party-wide artifact: all heroes +22% damage and -10 max HP.

`ArtifactData.general_pool` separates normal shop/elite/random artifacts from source-locked special artifacts. **СЛОМАННАЯ КОРОНА** has `general_pool = false`, so it can only be acquired from its named card. Party-wide artifacts use `target_role = "*"`.

Artifacts are applied to hero runtime stats when combat units spawn. The run-end summary now lists acquired artifacts.

The shared `scenes/event/act_choice.tscn` scene handles the implemented choice-driven events, including Ash Rest, Gravedigger Shop, Curse Forge, Black Altar, Chained Prisoner, Debtor Bones, Wizard Tithe, Faceless Card, Blood Ledger, Broken Crown, Last Camp, Rattling Bridge, Lost Purse, Candle Seller and Bone Tax. It still intentionally avoids a generalized event-effect framework.

### Run state

`scripts/core/run_state.gd`

The current prototype run state stores:

- gold;
- combat victories in `deals_survived` for backward compatibility;
- resolved pre-boss card count;
- remaining, offered, rejected and resolved card ids;
- active selected card id;
- global party HP bonus;
- global party damage bonus;
- last battle result;
- selected encounter path;
- boss completion state;
- persistent artifact ids;
- temporary `wizard_debt_active` state;
- randomized per-tier mandatory-combat slot indices in `forced_combat_slots`.

Act 1 ends after 12 resolved pre-boss cards plus Bone Warden.

## Not implemented yet

- second Act 1 balance pass after local full-run feedback on the first tuning pass;
- broader shop inventory/economy beyond the current Candle Seller and Gravedigger Shop implementations;
- more artifacts beyond the first three;
- attack projectiles/animations;
- broader ability/status-effect system;
- richer evil wizard presentation;
- deck building / card unlocks;
- meta progression;
- save/load.

## Immediate next milestone

Locally verify the complete combat-unit sprite pass on the authored battle backdrop:

- Knight, Ranger and Mage should match the richer dark-fantasy pixel reference and remain immediately distinguishable by silhouette/color;
- Skeleton and Bone Archer should use their new red-cloth undead designs rather than the earlier tiny simplified sprites;
- Grave Bellkeeper must visibly read as a robed bell-bearing support priest;
- Bone Thrall must remain clearly smaller/weaker than a normal Skeleton despite sharing the same art language;
- Crypt Guard must read as a heavier armored elite without covering nearby units or UI;
- Bone Warden must remain the largest and most threatening silhouette, with boss HP/name/phase effects still aligned around the new art;
- HP bars, names, team rings, drag placement, hit feedback and death effects must not collide with the larger/detail-rich sprites;
- all nine roles must keep nearest-neighbor pixel presentation with no smoothing;
- authored battle backdrop, combat movement, boss Phase II and existing encounter mechanics must remain unchanged.

If individual scale/offsets need adjustment after the local screenshot, tune presentation only; do not redraw the arena or change combat rules.

## Local workflow

The browser-side assistant edits the GitHub repository.

The user keeps a local clone and normally updates with:

`git pull`

`UPDATE_MISDEAL.bat` is also present as a one-click pull helper.

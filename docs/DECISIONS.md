# Misdeal — Decisions

This file records decisions that future chats should not casually reverse.

## D001 — Project name: Misdeal

Date: 2026-10-04  
Status: accepted

The game is named **Misdeal**.

The name evokes both an invalid/unfair card deal and a bad deal or bargain, matching the cursed-game premise.

## D002 — Godot + GDScript

Date: 2026-10-04  
Status: accepted

Use Godot 4.7.x and GDScript.

Do not move to C#/.NET without an explicit discussion and decision.

## D003 — Combat is a compact tactical autobattler

Date: 2026-10-04  
Status: accepted

Misdeal does not use Hand-of-Fate-style direct action combat.

Combat encounters become short autobattles where the player's primary agency comes from preparation, party composition, positioning, equipment and limited tactical choices.

The autobattler should remain compact and support the card roguelike rather than becoming a separate giant auto-chess game.

## D004 — Evil wizard replaces the dealer archetype

Date: 2026-10-04  
Status: accepted

An evil wizard is the host, antagonist and master of the cursed table.

He deals encounters, comments on the player's choices and provides the personality tying the run together.

## D005 — Vertical slice before architecture polish

Date: 2026-10-04  
Status: accepted

The primary development goal is to prove the playable loop quickly.

Prefer simple working implementations over speculative abstractions.

Refactor toward data-driven Resources when the next playable feature benefits from it.

## D006 — GitHub is the technical source of truth

Date: 2026-10-04  
Status: accepted

Repository: `zampolit73/Misdeal`

ChatGPT Project conversations provide useful design context, but the repository defines what is actually implemented.

Every fresh development chat should read the continuity documents listed in `AGENTS.md` before proposing code or architecture changes.

Significant sessions should update the repository documentation so work can continue from a new chat without reconstructing history manually.

## D007 — Browser assistant edits, user validates locally

Date: 2026-10-04  
Status: accepted

The assistant should make implementation changes directly through the connected GitHub repository when asked.

The user pulls those commits to the local Godot project and validates behavior in the editor/runtime.

Do not require manual code copying when the repository can be updated directly.

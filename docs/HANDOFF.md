# Misdeal — Canonical Working Handoff

Updated: 2026-10-16 — **D198 native release QA user-confirmed PASS; next D199/card #38**.

Source of truth: `zampolit73/Misdeal`, branch `main`. The assistant has direct connected GitHub read/write tools; do not ask the user to paste code, repeat project history or grant GitHub access without checking. Godot **4.7.x / GDScript**, no C# migration. Start a new chat by reading `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CONCEPT.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## Current exact milestone — Act 1 37/45 LIVE

RunState.ACT1_CARD_IDS includes 37 unique cards:
- #34 `funeral_procession`: original Funeral Priest + Pallbearers, Last Rite.
- #35 `defiled_laboratory`: original Alchemist + Homunculus, chemical hazards.
- #36 `threadbare_theatre`: **skeletal** Puppeteer + Marionettes, thread tethers; native D178 54/54 and D181 release-smoke PASS.
- #37 `black_crossing` / «Чёрная переправа»: original drowned Ferryman + 2 Drowned, two authored formations, storm surge.

The fate spread has **12 resolutions** then only sealed Bone Warden **XIII**. Eight more cards are planned to reach 45.

## Locked art, battle and native QA for Black Crossing #37

- Chosen card illustration **option 3** (448×274): `assets/pixel/card_unification_v1/run/black_crossing_approved_v1.webp.b64`.
- Ferryman **B** / Drowned **C** source-derived original 25-pose atlases, accepted D186.
- Stormy battle arena **«Последний причал»** 1280×720: `assets/pixel/battle/arenas/black_crossing_storm_pier_approved_v1.webp.b64`, accepted D187. Do not restore left rock towers or right timber frames that the user asked to remove.
- **D189** unit movement, placement, and sea push restricted to intact **upper pier planks**.
- **D191 native 54/54 combat PASS**, 0 full-party defeats, 18/18/18 wins per solo/duo/trio and Knight/Ranger/Mage; mean HP 86/74/77%, worst 58/42/50%. Storm effects: 78 warnings, 62 impacts, 66 pushes, 66 slow resets.
- **D196 visual baseline:** advancing breaker 94px with foam and runoff. User said **«давай пока оставим этот. продолжай»** — leave surf as-is, do not resume wave tuning without new user request.
- Local mechanics: initial delay 3.2s, warning 1.4s, wave push 43px left, temporary movement slow 30% for 1.6s on both factions, no raw damage, rest 4.5s. No global encounter or balance changes.
- **D197 Godot native real route user-confirmed:** preflight → actual Battle → Reward → Fate Spread/Table; user replied **«Все ок»**.
- **D198 Godot native release smoke USER-REPORTED PASS:** following `git pull` and F6 `res://scenes/dev/black_crossing_release_smoke.tscn` request, user replied **«все ок»** (2026-10-16). This is user-provided success feedback (not an independently captured Godot console/screenshot). Treat release QA gate as closed; do not request repeat D198 smoke.
- D198 `main` has card #37 registered for ordinary random Tier1 offers and updates former 36-card guards across previous smoke scenes. The release smoke verifies 37 unique cards, full live 37-card pool via **80 deterministic Tier1 random-deal trials**, selected encounter/choice/resolution, Fate Spread and boss XIII.

**No D198 tasks remain**; do not reopen #37, its asset selection, waves or balance unless the user identifies a new problem.

## Exact next action — D199 / Act 1 card #38

1. Present **2–3 genuinely different new card gameplay concepts** that suit Misdeal's cursed tabletop, dark fantasy and tactical loop; clarify their risk/reward and whether combat or event. User makes the selection — do not decide the type or fundamental design unilaterally.
2. For a fight-bearing card D143 requires **entirely new enemy identities/sprites** AND a localized new combat mechanic. Do not reuse the D151–D153 or drowned roster. Preserve solo/duo/trio and accepted systems.
3. After concept selection, show **2–3 actually rendered scene-led card art alternatives** before integrating the specific user-approved image (D167/D168). Use approved DS2 color/graphic baseline; avoid obvious AI repetition, micro-detail and showcase-of-sprites card compositions.
4. Develop focused data-driven Godot `.gd`/`.tscn`/`.tres` via GitHub. Perform source checks, ask user only for necessary Godot F6; for new combats include a meaningful matrix, real reward route and separate normal-deal release QA. Update `PROJECT_STATE`, `ROADMAP`, `DECISIONS` for new decisions, `CHANGELOG` and this `HANDOFF`, commit changes directly.

History: `docs/D188_BLACK_CROSSING_ENCOUNTER.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, D182–D198 Git commits. New chat does not need the prior conversation.

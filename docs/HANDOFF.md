# Misdeal — Current Handoff

Last updated: 2026-10-08

This file is the compact continuation point for a new ChatGPT Project chat. GitHub remains the source of truth for implemented state.

## Current baseline

Functional/visual baseline commit before this handoff archive: `bdc9246421b6a2efdd75cb3be3e750d87c485a01` — **Integrate final v9 event environments**.

The user locally confirmed the v7/v8 rollout and the table/battle brightness fixes as working/acceptable. The newest V9 event-environment package has been integrated in GitHub and is the next screenshot-validation target.

Do not ask the user to re-explain the recent visual history. Read this file, `docs/VISUAL_ASSET_REGISTRY.md`, `PROJECT_STATE`, `ROADMAP` and `DECISIONS`.

## What is now visually replaced

Broad Act 1 art replacement is considered complete.

- Main menu: approved authored splash, live transparent CTA hotspot.
- Intro: five authored 1280×720 frames.
- Wizard table: accepted v6 Wizard/table backdrop, live UI/cards, corrected midtones.
- All 25 active table cards: current v4/v5/object-specific art; no intentional unrelated-art fallback.
- Class Select: dedicated Knight / Ranger / Mage portraits.
- Squad Dossier: reuses the same dedicated portraits, not combat-sprite crops.
- Reward: dedicated v7 reward backdrop.
- Run End: dedicated v7 ending backdrop.
- Whispering Well: dedicated v7 environment.
- Curse Forge, Chained Prisoner, Black Altar: dedicated v7 environments.
- Candle Seller, Gravedigger Shop, Blood Ledger, Faceless Card: dedicated v8 environments.
- Rattling Bridge, Lost Purse, Debtor Bones, Bone Tax, Wizard Tithe, Ash Rest, Last Camp, Broken Crown: dedicated v9 environments.
- Battles: native-HD authored Crypt/Gallows and v6 Graveyard/Ossuary/Warden/Bone Crush; Bone Crush deployment/combat bounds were aligned to the visible floor.

## V9 event mapping

The shared live event scene is `scenes/event/act_choice.tscn`, driven by `scripts/event/act_choice.gd`.

| card_id | Player-facing card | Runtime art |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rattling_bridge` | ГРЕМУЧИЙ МОСТ | `assets/pixel/event/v9/rattling_bridge.webp` |
| `lost_purse` | КОШЕЛЬ МЕРТВЕЦА | `assets/pixel/event/v9/lost_purse.webp` |
| `debtor_bones` | КОСТИ ДОЛЖНИКА | `assets/pixel/event/v9/debtor_bones.webp` |
| `bone_tax` | КОСТЯНАЯ ПОШЛИНА | `assets/pixel/event/v9/bone_tax.webp` |
| `wizard_tithe` | ДЕСЯТИНА ВОЛШЕБНИКА | `assets/pixel/event/v9/wizard_tithe.webp` |
| `ash_rest` | ПЕПЕЛЬНЫЙ ПРИВАЛ | `assets/pixel/event/v9/ash_rest.webp` |
| `last_camp` | ПОСЛЕДНИЙ ПРИВАЛ | `assets/pixel/event/v9/last_camp.webp` |
| `broken_crown` | СЛОМАННАЯ КОРОНА | `assets/pixel/event/v9/broken_crown.webp` |

The original generated V9 compositions are also preserved as larger 1672×941 Q95 WebP masters under `assets/source_archive/visual_pass_v9/`. Those archive files are not runtime dependencies; they exist so later art work can crop/re-export from the approved generated source instead of regenerating from memory.

## Important runtime-art rule

Godot 4.7.2 locally failed when newly committed WebPs were referenced directly through `preload()` or new `Texture2D` scene ext_resources before import state was ready.

For new authored screen WebPs, use the established runtime path:

- `scripts/ui/runtime_webp_texture.gd`
- `FileAccess`
- `Image.load_webp_from_buffer()`
- cached `ImageTexture`

Do not reintroduce direct preloads for newly added WebP screen art unless locally proven safe.

## Visual lessons already learned

Do not repeat these rejected passes:

- 112×69 card cells enlarged to live card size: rejected as muddy/blocky.
- 320×180 arena cells enlarged to 1280×720: rejected as visibly low quality.
- strong environment/card post-grading on already-dark authored art: rejected because it crushed midtones to black.
- broad generic AI-fantasy density with equal-detail candles/bones/ornament everywhere: rejected as obviously generated and hard to read.
- full-screen generated UI screenshots with baked prices/buttons/stats: do not use as production UI; dynamic state stays native Godot controls.
- combat units placed over architecture rather than the painted floor: explicitly fixed for Bone Crush and should remain a layout check for future arenas.

Accepted direction:

- authored dark-gothic pixel look;
- large quiet masses and readable focal subjects;
- fewer decorative micro-details;
- native/near-display resolution;
- live UI over authored environment art;
- nearest presentation where appropriate;
- preserve dark midtones rather than crushing everything to black.

## Current gameplay state that must not be accidentally changed by visual work

- Godot 4.7.x + GDScript.
- Act 1: 12 resolved cards, then Bone Warden boss.
- Run starts with exactly one chosen protagonist.
- Companions can be recruited/lost; solo/duo/trio is real run state.
- Solo compensation: HP ×2, damage ×1.8, attacks/sec ×1.25, movement ×1.10.
- Duo: +20% HP, +15% damage.
- Bone Warden remains a fixed benchmark.
- Tactical orders: НАТИСК / ОХОТА / СТРОЙ plus temporary ЖЕРТВА / НЕПОВИНОВЕНИЕ when unlocked.
- Wizard wagers, debt, marks, holds, memory, rescue scars and Last Deal are implemented systems.
- Visual passes must not silently alter mechanics, prices, stats, card odds or encounter composition.

## Latest local-fix follow-up

A 2026-10-08 Gallows Volley screenshot showed units, especially retreating ranged roles, climbing into the authored background above the visible floor. The encounter now uses a tighter floor-aligned combat rectangle, matching deployment band and adjusted party start positions. This is a movement-space fix for every unit in Gallows Volley, not an archer-only workaround. It is pending local verification.

The current V9 event environments were also reviewed directly from the repository against `docs/ART_DIRECTION.md`. Several remain visually over-detailed and repeat the same candles / gothic skyline / red-banner language. Do not replace them blindly; prioritize object-first redraws where local event screenshots confirm the mismatch, while keeping live UI/text untouched.

## Latest targeted battle fix

A post-handoff screenshot exposed Gallows Volley units visually moving over the background architecture. `main` now lowers/tightens that encounter's legal combat floor, moves hero/enemy spawns onto the stone platform, and clamps all units immediately when combat bounds are assigned. This is pending local verification, especially ranged retreat and separation with solo/duo/trio parties.

## Exact next step

Do not begin another broad art-generation pass.

1. User pulls latest `main`.
2. Re-run **ЗАЛП С ВИСЕЛИЦЫ** and verify that retreat/chase/separation keep every unit on the stone floor.
3. Locally open/check the eight V9 events at 1280×720. The repository review already flags the generic-event batch as denser than the production target; use fresh live screenshots to choose the first object-first redraws instead of doing another blind eight-screen replacement.
4. Fix only concrete event defects: excessive detail, weak focal subject, darkness, text/art collisions, hidden subject, crop or wrong semantic mapping.
5. Then switch priority back to full vertical-slice validation from menu → intro → class select → 12-card Act 1 → Bone Warden → run end, including solo/duo/trio balance and tactical-order behavior.

## Git workflow

The assistant has connected GitHub access in Project chats and should use it directly when implementation/fixes are requested. Do not repeatedly tell the user Git access is unavailable without first checking the connected GitHub tools.

The user normally needs only:

`git pull`

then restart/run Godot and report screenshots/errors.
